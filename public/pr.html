      <h1>Pull Request (PR)</h1>
      <p>A PR is used in the git flow when you want to collaborate into a project.</p>
      <p>Is a better way than a simple merge to a repository, because that way your team can pre-check your work before you do any change/merge into a repo branch.</p>
      <p>At least one person of your team must review your changes, and can tell you if it's ok or if something must be changed.</p>
      <p>When everything is ok and your code is accepted, then the merge can be done, and that way nothing goes wrong with it (theoretically).</p>
      <p>You can learn more in the github documentation <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">in the github documentation</a>.</p>
